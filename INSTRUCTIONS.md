**INSTRUCTIONS**


These extensions have been tested in Ubuntu 23.10 running in a virtual environment.


WARNING: The procedure below will reset your user configuration to mine, but you can add your changes again afterwards. If you have the knowledge, a better way would be to edit your dconf user configuration file and use my file to manually add the extension changes.


NOTE: If you only need certain extensions, you can just copy those from the downloaded gnome-extensions folder to your local gnome-extensions folder, log out and back in, then use Extension Manager to enable and configure them.


There are a total of 63 extensions and include the most popular and useful extensions. These extensions have been configured the way I use them. Not all extensions have been enabled. You can use Extension Manager to enable/disable and configure all the extensions to your liking.



1. Once you have unzipped the file, go to home/.local/share/gnome-extensions and delete all files contained within.

2. Copy all the extesion files in the downloaded gnome-extensions folder to the above folder.

3. Go to /home/.config/dconf and delete the user file.

4. Copy the user file in the downloaded dconf folder to the above folder.

5. Log out and back in.



Cheers!
