**A Collection of Gnome 45.2 compatible Shell Extensions**



These extensions have been tested in Ubuntu 23.10 running in a virtual environment.



A very sincere Thank You to all the various Developers that have been working around the clock to make these extensions compatible and available for free!!



**INSTRUCTIONS**



<u>WARNING:</u> The procedure below will reset your user configuration to mine, but you can add your changes again afterwards. If you have the knowledge, a better way would be to edit your dconf user configuration file and use my file to manually add the extension changes.



There are a total of 63 extensions and include the most popular and useful extensions I am using on my daily PC (Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS), so these extensions have been set the way I use them. Not all extensions have been enabled because they are not used by me. You can use Extension Manager to enable/disable and configure all the extensions to your liking.



1. Once you have unzipped the file, go to home/.local/share/gnome-extensions and delete all files contained within.

2. Copy all the extesion files in the downloaded gnome-extensions folder to the above folder.

3. Go to /home/.config/dconf and delete the user file.

4. Copy the user file in the downloaded dconf folder to the above folder.

5. Logout and back in.



Cheers!
